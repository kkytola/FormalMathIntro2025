noncomputable section
-- If we didn't mark things noncomputable, Lean would complain about the definition of `X - 3` etc.

-- Introduce two polynomials `p, q ∈ ℂ[X]` with complex coefficients:
-- `p := X - 3`
-- `q := X + 3`

def p : ℂ[X] := X - 3
def q : ℂ[X] := X + 3

-- Addition of polynomials:
#check p + q

-- Multiplication of polynomials:
#check p * q

-- Some statements about polynomials:
#check p + q = 2 * X
#check p * q = X^2 - 9
--#check p + q = X^361 + 42

The first two statements above are true and provable. But Lean does indeed request proofs,
it will not just admit statements. The proofs are not long, given the right tools; we will
learn such tools later, you don't need to worry about the details yet, but you can inspect
what is happening if you want to.
